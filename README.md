## What is Cognizen?
Cognizen is a collaborative content creation and development tool that utilizes an intuitive WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing environment and drag-and-drop media integration. This tool accomodates remote users in multiple locations to collaboratively create content in a unified environment providing a low end configuration management and versioning system for content.  Cognizen efficiently generates single-source, mobile-friendly HTML 5 content  that is both SCORM conformant and Section 508 compliant.  Cognizen encompasses the entire content development lifecycle from storyboarding to deployment within an intuitive user interface by providing features that easily enable users to author, edit, and review content, assign and track issues, integrate media, publish content, and apply versioning in a secure – yet flexible – online development environment.  Primarily constructed as a content creation environment for online and distance learning products by the Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC) Education and Training (E&T) division, Cognizen is also a powerful tool for building multi/single-player games, interactive media solutions, iPad applications, and web content. 


## What does Cognizen do?
Cognizen was built primarily to improve efficiency, reduce development costs, and address production and deployment requirements within the E&T division for the purpose of offering competitive, cost-effective content development solutions for our clientele. This is done in part through the rapid development of content through the use of instructional templates creating speed in the development of content, while providing a controlled/managed work environment for configuration management, review and project management.

Cognizen gives the power of course development to the content creator! This flexibility allows Cognizen to be used to support Micro-Learning, Mobile Learning, Shared Note-taking and collaboration, and in the near future, full online hosting and management of content.


## How does Cognizen work?
Cognizen separates the data from the display method by storing all content data in an XML document ensuring the data can remain portable and reusable.

## Why is CTC taking Cognizen to the open source environment?
We built Cognizen to provide our clients with cost-effective web-based and distance learning products that easily integrate with established systems and processes.  Throughout the years, Cognizen has grown to become a powerful training product development tool and has allowed CTC to become more competitive in the market. More importantly, it has afforded our clients the accessibility – financially, technologically, and supportively – to fulfill their training needs making learning accessible to our warfighters, other DoD entities, and anyone else who needs to provide training to a target audience.  Cognizen is ever-developing with new features and as technology advances and learning needs change. Now, we want the experts in the fields of web-development, software engineering, design, and instructional methodologies to participate in our quest to make Cognizen the best it can be.


## How does Cognizen compare to other products?
Compared to industry standards developing distance learning products and analyzing the Chapman Alliance study to make these determinations, Cognizen has shown a 10-15% reduction in the level of effort in labor hours.
